# SMS-Spam-Detection

## Data:
Data used for this project is downloaded from kaggle. Here is the link for the data: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

## Tasks Performed:
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Extraction
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train-Test Split
- Training on 6 six different machine learning classifiers
- Comparing results

Trained multiple Machine Learning models to classify SMS as Spam or Ham.

## Machine Learning Classifiers Used:
Used scikit learn library in python to predict spam.
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN with 5 different values of k)
- Decision Trees 

All of the classifiers performed almost equally well.
